## Intro to Waptcha üíØ

ü™ê Welcome to Waptcha, a cutting-edge anti-bot solution that uses World ID for human verification, providing robust security with a simple 3-line JavaScript SDK integration.

## Project Description üåü

### üóÇÔ∏è Problem Statement
As bots become increasingly sophisticated, traditional CAPTCHA systems are failing to provide effective security. Many bots can now mimic human behavior, allowing them to bypass these verification methods. This poses significant risks for websites and applications that handle sensitive data, leading to issues such as fraud, spam, and compromised user experiences.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution 

- Utilizes Worldcoin's biometric technology to ensure that each user is uniquely identified through privacy-preserving biometric data, effectively preventing bot manipulation.

- Offers a streamlined integration process with a lightweight JavaScript SDK, allowing developers to implement Waptcha in just three lines of code, thus minimizing development overhead.
  
- Provides robust protection against advanced bots, making it ideal for applications that handle sensitive information.

### üíª Get Started
https://waptcha.vercel.app/





This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
